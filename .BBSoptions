# The reason this is marked as unsupported on win32 is that we don't want
# to build the hisat2 binary twice. There is no library code in
# src/, just the code to build the hisat2 executable. So we mark the package
# as unsupported on win32 to avoid building it twice. I'm adding this
# comment so if/when someone notices that the lack of support on win32
# conflicts with what it says on the package landing page. Basically,
# the landing page shows the architectures listed in the Archs field of
# the repository index file (if there is no such field, it assumes the package
# has no native code and can be run on both sub-archs). 
UnsupportedPlatforms: win32
